# What's new in `plyrmr` 0.2.0

* Fast summaries
* `.data` variable
* new pipe operators `%|%` `%!%`
* vectorized grouping
* optimizations for nested grouping
* heuristic to avoid name changes in recursive group
* `.` special argument for `%|%` operator
* `where` takes a single argument now
* `select` allows fractional recycling `select(mtcars, even = c(FALSE, TRUE), triad = 1:3, .replace = FALSE)`
* `.columns` argument for select


* fixed bug that resulted in column duplication
* removed `pryr` dependency with modest borrowing of code courtesy of @hadley
* more aggressive *freezing* of environments to make delayed evaluation and pipe optimization semantically neutral
* uncountable corner cases addressed (things like 0-rows, 0-columns etc, please report any broken corner case, they are all important)
